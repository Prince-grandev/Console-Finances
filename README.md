### BRIEF INTRODUCTION
This was a rather interesting project and defintely tested my knowledge of syntax as well as problem solving.


### PROCEDURE
Given that the dataset was a 2D Array I had to deconstruct the array in order to access the elements in it.

This was done using the filter() function.

// Total Number of Months included in the dataset.
Counted the number of months in the refined data set using
using .length attribute,

// The Net Total Amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period
Found the sum of all arrays in profitLossess

//The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.


//The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire.

// How do you only print to the nearest 100th in JavaScript?
Utilize the toFixed() function. For the nearest hundereth, sample code below.

let a = 2060.34567

let roundedNumber = a.toFixed(2); // Rounds to two decimal places
console.log(roundedNumber); // Output: 123.46

### CONCLUSION
The exercise was brilliant and definitely incentivised doing more reading and research.
